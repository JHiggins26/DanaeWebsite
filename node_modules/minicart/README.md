# minicart.js

The minicart is a great way to improve your PayPal shopping cart integration. One simple change and your users will be able to manage their shopping cart directly from your website. Additional APIs provide you the power to customize the behavior to your needs.

## Basic Setup

1. Create a PayPal [Add to Cart Button](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/xcl/web-accept-to-sc-button-outside)
2. Include the following snippet of JavaScript code into your HTML file, ideally before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag:

```html
<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/minicart/3.0.1/minicart.min.js"></script>
<script>
    paypal.minicart.render();
</script>
```

It’s that simple! Now the minicart will appear when a user views or adds a product to their cart.



## Advanced API

The minicart has an advanced JavaScript API which provides you the power to customize the behavior to your needs.


### General

`paypal.minicart.render(config)`  
Renders the minicart to the page. Config is optional and can have the following properties:

 * `parent` - HTMLElement the minicart should render to.
 * `target` - HTML target property for the checkout form. 
 * `action` - PayPal URL (if you are accessing sandbox or another version of the PayPal website).
 * `template` - HTML template for rendering. See [customization](#customization) for details.
 * `styles` - CSS styles for rendering. See [customization](#customization) for details.
 * `strings` - An object of text strings: `button`, `buttonAlt`, `subtotal` and `discount`. 

`paypal.minicart.reset()`  
Resets the minicart back to it's default state.


### View

`paypal.minicart.show()`  
Triggers the minicart to show by adding a "minicart-showing" CSS class to the page.

`paypal.minicart.hide()`

## API Examples

Examples of how you can use the API:

* [Preventing checkout until terms are accepted](https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart/blob/master/examples/terms.html)
* [Requiring a minimum quantity to checkout](https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart/blob/master/examples/minquantity.html)
* [Only allowing a fixed quantity per item](https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart/blob/master/examples/fixedquantity.html)
* [Ensuring an option is selected](https://github.com/jeffharrell/minicart/blob/master/examples/notempty.html)


## Customization

The minicart's HTML template and CSS can be fully customized using two different approaches: configuration and custom themes. In both approaches, all functionality from the [API](#advanced-api) is available using [Embedded JavaScript Template](https://github.com/visionmedia/ejs) syntax.


### Configuration

The HTML template and CSS can be overridden using the `config` object. Example:

    var myTemplate = '' +
    	'<div>' +
    	'<%= config.strings.subtotal %> ' +
    	'<%= cart.total({ format: true, currencyCode: true }) %>' +
    	'</div>';

    paypal.minicart.render({
        template: myTemplate
    });


### Custom Themes

Custom themes can also be created and bundle into the JavaScript file. To create a theme you'll need to have [grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) and follow these steps:

1. Fork or clone this repo
2. Create a directory under `src/themes`, e.g. `myTheme`
3. Create an `index.html` file for your template and `styles.css` for the CSS
4. Run `grunt build --theme=myTheme` to generate the JavaScript
5. Include `dist/minicart.myTheme.js` in your page to see your custom minicart

If you're new to the building a theme it's probably a good idea to copy the default one and start there.



## Localization

Localization is supported using the `strings` object. Example:

    paypal.minicart.render({
		strings: {
			button: "Caisse",  
			buttonAlt: "Total:",
			discount: "Réduction:"
			processing: "Traitement"
		}
	});

The currency symbol will be automatically updated based on the `currency_code` setting of your button.



## FAQ

### Is the minicart free? How is it licensed?
Yes, it’s free and licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jeffharrell/MiniCart/raw/master/LICENSE).

### Which browsers are supported?
The minicart supports Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Internet Explorer 8+.

### I made a change and want to contribute it. Do you accept pull requests?
Yes, absolutely. Please submit a pull request on Github.

### Help! I found a bug!
Please log the issue on the [minicart’s issue tracker](https://github.com/jeffharrell/MiniCart/issues) including a link or sample code that reproduces it.

### The minicart isn’t appearing the same as on this page. Why?
This can occur if your page is being rendered in the browser’s [Quirks mode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quirks_mode). You can check for this issue, validate and correct your HTML markup using the [W3C Markup Validator](http://validator.w3.org/).

### I installed the minicart, but my website still redirects to PayPal. Why?
The minicart doesn’t work with PayPal's “hosted” buttons which is why this is most likely happening. To fix your buttons, log into paypal.com and do the following steps:

1. Create a button on PayPal’s website and uncheck the Save button at PayPal checkbox under Step 2: Track inventory, profit & loss.
2. Once you’ve created the button click Remove code protection before copying your button’s code.

### The minicart isn’t emptying after a transaction is completed. Why?
Your buttons need a `return` URL parameter for PayPal to redirect back to. On this page make sure to call `paypapl.minicart.reset();`.

### Does the minicart work with frames?
Frames are not officially supported, but you may be able to get some mileage with the `target` configuration setting.

### Are previous versions of the minicart available?
All previous versions are [tagged on Github](https://github.com/jeffharrell/MiniCart/tags).
